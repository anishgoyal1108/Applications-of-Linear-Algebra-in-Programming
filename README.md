## About

This repository contains **all my assignments for Applications of Linear Algebra in Programming**, a course offered at GSMST that audits content from *Coding the Matrix*, a course taught at Brown University, which explores how linear algebra is applied in various areas of programming.

Each assignment is housed in its own folder, containing a compiled PDF for easy reading, and the original source code files written in **Quarto Markdown** (with the file extension `.qmd`). The assignments cover a range of topics from introductory concepts to more advanced applications such as error correction and matrix inversions.

## How to Access the Assignment Files

To access the solutions for each assignment:
1. Navigate to the respective folder for the chapter or lab.
2. Inside each folder, you will find a **PDF file** that contains the final write-up of the assignment.
3. You can also view the **`.qmd` files**, which contain the source code used to generate the PDF via Quarto.
