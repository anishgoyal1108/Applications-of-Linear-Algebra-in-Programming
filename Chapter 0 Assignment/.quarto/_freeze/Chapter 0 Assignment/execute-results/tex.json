AKA: $f$ is a function that maps $A$ to $B$.\n\n### What are the criteria for $f$ to be an invertible function?\n\n- $f \\circ g$ is defined and the identity function on the domain of $g$\n- $g \\circ f$ is defined and the identity function on the domain of $f$\n\n### What is the associativity of functional composition?\n\n$h \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f$\n\n### What are the criteria for a function to be a probability function?\n\n-   The function must output a non-negative real number for all inputs.\n-   The function must be measurable, meaning it must correspond to some set that can be assigned a probability.\n\n### What is the Fundamental Principle of Probability Theory?\n\nThe probability of an event is the sum of probabilities.\n\n### If the input to an invertible function is chosen randomly according to the uniform distribution, what is the distribution of the output?\n\nThe output will also have a uniform distribution. This is because an invertible function is a one-to-one mapping, so it preserves the uniformity of the distribution. In other words, every possible output value will have the same probability of being produced, as every possible input value has the same probability of being chosen.\n\n## 0.8 Problems\n\n### Problem 0.8.1\n\nincrements(L)\\\ninput: list L of numbers\\\noutput: list of numbers in which the ith element is one plus the ith element Example: increments(\\[1, 5, 7\\]) should return \\[2, 6, 8\\]\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef increments(L): return [x+1 for x in L]\nprint(increments([1, 5, 7]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[2, 6, 8]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Problem 0.8.2\n\ncubes(L)\\\ninput: list L of numbers\\\noutput: list of numbers in which the ith element is the cube of the ith element of L.\\\nExample: given \\[1, 2, 3\\] return \\[1, 8, 27\\]\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef cubes(L): return[x**3 for x in L]\nprint(cubes([1, 2, 3]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1, 8, 27]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Problem 0.8.3\n\ntuple_sum(A, B)\\\ninput: lists A and B of the same length, where each element in each list is a pair (x, y) of numbers\\\noutput: list of pairs (x, y) in which the first element of the ith pair is the sum of the first element of the ith pair in A and the first element of the ith pair in B\\\nExample: given lists \\[(1, 2), (10, 20)\\] and \\[(3, 4), (30, 40)\\], return \\[(4, 6), (40, 60)\\]\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef tuple_sum(A, B): return [(x[0]+y[0], x[1]+y[1]) for x, y in zip(A, B)]\nA= [(1, 2), (10, 20)]\nB = [(3, 4), (30, 40)]\nprint(tuple_sum(A, B))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[(4, 6), (40, 60)]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Problem 0.8.4\n\ninv_dict(d)\\\ninput: dictionary d representing an invertible function f\\\noutput: dictionary representing the inverse of f, the returned dictionary's keys are the value of d and its values are the keys of d\\\nExample: given an English-French dictionary:\\\n{'thank you' : 'merci', 'goodbye' : 'au revoir'}\\\nreturn a French-English dictionary:\\\n{'merci' : 'thank you', 'au revoir' : 'goodbye'}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef inv_dict(d): return {v: k for k, v in d.items()}\nd = {'thank you' : 'merci', 'goodbye' : 'au revoir'}\nprint(inv_dict(d))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{'merci': 'thank you', 'au revoir': 'goodbye'}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Problem 0.8.5\n\nFirst write a procedure row with the following spec:\\\ninput: integer p, integer n\\\noutput: n-element list such that element i is p+i\\\nExample: given p = 10 and n = 4, return \\[10, 11, 12, 13\\]\\\nNext, write a comprehension whose value is a 15-element list of 20-element lists such that the jth element of the ith list is i+j.
